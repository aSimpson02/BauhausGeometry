# Bauhaus Geometry
In this project, i implement image manipulation in java inspired by by the works of the artist László Moholy-Nagy

## Analyzation of Artist’s works:​
László Moholy-Nagy’s works all meet the principles of the Bauhaus design movement: They consist of constructive geometric shapes. However, what makes his art more unique is how he plays with colour, light and placement. ​
​
He purposely likes to layer a lot of shapes on each other, colours seem faded (with more tone) and there are multiple uses of images/shapes distributed at different places.​
​
I wanted to see if I could use the three elements above to create a sketch of my own inspired by my chosen artist.​
​
Moholy-Nagy combined art with photography and later on early technologies to create his works. He experimented a lot with the photogram, which involves light sensitive materials/papers with objects laid upon it. One of the reasons for this may be his wife, who was an actress, and encouraged and worked with him on cinematic/ photographic projects. 


## My inspirations:​
Two works that I wanted to take inspiration from were “the law of series”, 1925 and “space modulator L3”, 1936. I wanted to use a piece that had photographs in them, since they were such a major influence in his life, and a work with abstract uses of shapes and colours. ​
​
I really took an interest to the aesthetic of his works, they meet the principles of the Bauhaus design movement. I was particularly drawn to it from how he manipulates images and shapes through the use of colour, texture, placement, repetition and more. 


## Project Description
This project is a Java-based sketch that visualisses the principles and aesthetics of the Bauhaus design from Moholy-Nagy’s art. It uses vector abstraction to create geometric shapes and compositions, experimenting with colour, positioning and light.
